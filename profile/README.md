# 👋 Welcome

Welcome to **BOII Development** — your friendly neighborhood dev studio pumping out **high-quality, FiveM scripts** like it’s a full-time job (it kinda is).  
From **hunting and fishing** to full **utility libraries**, we build with performance and extensibility in mind.  
And yes, we actually document things. Shocking, right?

## 🧠 What's Offered Here?

This GitHub is home to all of our free, open source resources.  
It’s a dedicated space for open development, completely separate from our paid offerings over on Tebex.  
Whether you're learning, building, or just here to peek at the source, you're welcome.

> 💡 Looking for paid scripts or advanced systems? Check out [our store](https://boiidevelopment.tebex.io) for that side of the operation.
